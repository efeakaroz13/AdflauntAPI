    <h1>Tech Stack</h1>
    <p>We use mongo DB and python flask combined together on this API. You can find every detail about using this API on this page.</p>
    <br>
    <h1> Uploading to this server</h1>
    <p>So in every endpoint with a file input statement, you need to upload the file to the /api/upload and put the given filename to the parameter.</p>
    <br>
    <code>
        /api/upload - POST<br>
        'file' - send file to this endpoint, no more documentation here. 
    </code>
    <br>
