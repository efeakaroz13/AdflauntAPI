    <title>Documentation and details of Private API</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Tech Stack</h1>
    <p>We use mongo DB and python flask combined together on this API. You can find every detail about using this API on this page.</p>
    <br>
    <h1> Uploading to this server</h1>
    <p>So in every endpoint with a file input statement, you need to upload the file to the /api/upload and put the given filename to the parameter.</p>
    <br>
    <code>
        /api/upload - POST<br>
        'file' - send file to this endpoint, no more documentation here. 
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Authentication</h1>

        "phoneNumber" - Phone number, simple.<br>

        <br>

        "notificationID" - Firebase notification ID<br>
        one of email and phone number should be mentioned while using the API, it can work with both.<br>
    </code>
    <br><br>
    <code>
        /api/getuser/byid GET <br>
        'id' as URL argument <br>


    </code>
    <h1>Profile and Credential Updating</h1>
    <h2>Profile update(you can't update phonenumber email or password)</h2>
    <p>In this section '/api/updateprofile' you will send POST requests to this endpoint. You are able to use the same things in register, it will automatically understand the data you sent. IPDATA is not required but you are still able to send.</p>
    <h2>Credential Updating</h2>
    <code>
        ENDPOINT: /api/update_login_credentials METHOD: POST <br>
        # You are able to authenticate with just email or just phoneNumber or by using both <br>
        # Required: email or phoneNumber,password <br>
        # optional: <br>
        #new_password, new_phoneNumber, new_email
        # I'm not explain what they mean, they are very self explanatory.
    </code>
    <h2>Profile View</h2>
    <code>
        /api/getprofile/userID GET <br>
        this endpoint will give the user data from the database <br>
    </code>
    <h1>User report system</h1>
    <code>
        /api/report/-userID of the suspect- POST <br>
        required form parameters: <br>
        email,password,phoneNumber(of current user) <br>
        title,description(of report) <br>
        

    </code>
    <h1>Bug reporting system</h1>
    <p>This endpoint is for the shake function on mobile and with this endpoint user will be able to trace bugs and reports with screenshot attachment.</p>
    <code>
        /api/report/bugs - POST - GET[not finished yet, it will be a admin panel url] <br>
        "email" - for verification <br>
        "password" - for verification <br>
        "title" <br>
        "description" <br>
        "bugImage":as a static image url <br>
        "phoneNumber" - for verification <br>

    </code>
    <h1>Id verification</h1>
    <p>So this is a long topic, I didn't do anything on serverside. You need to handle all data from app-side. From this endpoint you will be able to add ID verified state to the database and add the static image name.
        Let me start by united states state identity cards: every state has their own card with different kind of layout and information. It is a little hard to get all the information turned into text. If you can crop the image of the person just directly from the ID card, it would be so cool.
    </p>
    <code>
        <br>
        /api/verify/ID - POST  <br>
        email,password,phoneNumber(if you didn't pass email) <br>
        photoOfId - You will need to just upload the photo to the upload url and give the returned name.
    </code> <br>
    <br>

    <h1>Reviews,proofs,orders and balances</h1>
     <p>In this API the order system has 3 phases:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>waitingForApproval</li>
        <li>activeOrders</li>
        <li>doneOrders</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Once you order something(you will get the money from customer with additional printing fee) with this API, it first checks availability for booking  and if so, it adds it to bookings-> listing-> waitingForApproval. After that, user will wait for admin to approve their order and print. After that the order will be active on profile. User will be able to see the data when they want and it's status. But host will not receive anything until admin approves it. For completing the orders these are the steps that both user and host will follow:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>After receiving the package of ad which is printed by Adflaunt, host will send the user a proof with list of images or just one, demonstrating that the host is displaying your ad in correct position. </li>
        <li>When hosts sends the proof, user will have the option to accept it or not. If not, they will contact customer support and adflaunt will handle the banning and user reporting</li>
        <li>If user accepts it, payment will go to host's profile(not directly to their bank)</li>
        <li>If host wants to hold all their money in our sytem it will be ok for them, once they want to withdraw money from their account using the API down below.</li>
